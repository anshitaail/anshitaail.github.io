			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As if the strings were thine, shou1dst know of this. </p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, </p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Off-capp’d to him; and, by the faith of man, </p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And, in conclusion, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Nonsuits my mediators; for, “Certes,” says he, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">“I have already chose my officer.” </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And what was he? </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Forsooth, a great arithmetician, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That never set a squadron in the field, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Nor the division of a battle knows </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Wherein the toged consuls can propose </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election; </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">By debator and creditor. This counter-caster, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And I -God bless the mark!- his Moorship’s ancient. </p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. </p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why, there’s no remedy. ‘Tis the curse of service, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Preferment goes by letter and affection, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And not by old gradation, where each second </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Whether I in any just term am affined </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To love the Moor. </p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I would not follow him then. </p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O, sir, content you. </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I follow him to serve my turn upon him: </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That doting on his own obsequious bondage </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d. </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Who, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And throwing but shows of service on their lords </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And such a one do I profess myself. </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For, sir, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">It is as sure as you are Roderigo, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago. </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In following him, I follow but myself; </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But seeming so, for my peculiar end. </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For when my outward action doth demonstrate </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The native act and figure of my heart </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In complement extern, ‘tis not long after </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. </p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Roderigo </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe, </p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Iago </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Call up her father, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy, </p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My very noble and approved good masters, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">It is most true; true, I have married her; </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The very head and front of my offending </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, </p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Their dearest action in the tented field, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And little of this great world can I speak, </p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Virtue? a fig! ‘Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect or scion. </p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Roderigo </p>

I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration-put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoyher- therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her. </p>

Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyselfa pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu. </p>
